Hello All, 

My name is Bharath. I have build this project "Bike_Taxi" web-app using Python and Django. Also made this website fully Responsive on all devices.
Tech Stack Used:
1. Python
2. Django
3. Django channels
4. HTML
5. CSS
6. JavaScript
7. Bootstrap version 5
8. Bootstrap Icons
9. Database default django's db.sqlite3
10. Some Images

Working of this Web_APP:
1. Initially when any user visits the page for first time, they'll be viewing Home page where user can navigate
   to see About page, Safety Page, Login page, Sign-up page and Sign-up as driver page.
2. If the user sign-up as customer or as driver, they'll be Registered in our Database and can Login using their credentials.
3. If the user is Customer, then they can Book a Ride by filling source and destination location.
4. When customer books a ride, initially their status will be under waiting time, and based on the Driver's response the customer's status gets change
   automatically as follows: (Waiting, Ride accepted, In-Progress, Ride cancelled, Ride Ended).
5. When Driver login's and switch on his "on duty" button then, he'll be waiting for a new trip. When customer books a ride then the driver will receive a notification
   on his dashboard with these following details ( Source, Destination, Customer Name, Customer mobile number, Pick-up point, and Estimated Rate).
6. If driver accepts the ride, then he'll go to the customer's pick-up point and after reaching pick-up both driver and customer status will change to In-progress and when they reach their destination
   then driver will clicks on "End ride" then collects the cash from customer and again he'll be waitng for new ride.
7. If driver accepts the ride then customer will get driver's details like Driver name, Mobile number, vehicle number, and his current location.
8. If driver cancels the ride request then both customer will serach for new drivers and driver will be searching for new trips.
9. Later when driver goes OFF Duty then he'll be able to see his Earnings and Ride history. But Customer will be able to see only their Ride history in their profile.
10. Lastly both driver and customer can logout by clicking on logout button.
